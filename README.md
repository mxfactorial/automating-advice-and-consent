### automating advice and consent

a world built by engineers and run by politicians is ridiculous

showing up to the table with nothing but "ok ive collected a bunch of paper with my name written on it and now im going to tell everyone what to do and how things should work" is a social hack that allows substituting the knowledge gained by designing and building useful resources with entertaining speeches and approval ratings

enforcing a conservation law on transaction data and publishing individual productivity protects builders from the plots of social hackers who want to lead more than they want to do their homework and test the value of its result with their own labor and property

the "advice and consent" phoned in by the design of contemporary upper houses does **not** belong to more cleverly spoken and heavily networked vote collectors, but the measurable actions of those who defend and improve the publics well being

when vote collectors attempt to skip a step by treating the progress produced by builders as capital to fund cutting their own public asset management chops, setting **merit** as the "upper house" provides to builders a natural defense by responding:

"yea, first youre gonna find a real job, physically prove you know how to build and grow your own property at the enterprise scale, then you have our *consent* to come back here and issue us your opinions about how to do that at the public scale"
